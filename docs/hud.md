## HUD Configuration

HUD configurations are stored in the DSDAHUD lump. These defaults can be changed by replacing the lump or specifying a hud config file with `-hud filename`. There are separate configurations for each game (doom, heretic, and hexen), with or without the status bar.

### Specification

A HUD configuration starts with the environment: `game variant`
- The `game` is `doom`, `heretic`, or `hexen`
- The `variant` options are:
  - `ex` (with status bar and extended hud on)
  - `off` (with status bar and extended hud off)
  - `full` (without status bar)
  - `map` (on top of the automap)

The configuration then consists of a series of components to display: `name x y alignment [args]`
- The `name` specifies which component to display
- The `x` and `y` fields set the location of the component
  - `y` values are automatically adjusted for different font heights
- The `alignment` controls how the position is translated in different screen sizes
  - `top`
  - `top_left`
    - This alignment accounts for the size of the message area
  - `top_right`
  - `bottom`
  - `bottom_left`
  - `bottom_right`
  - `left`
  - `right`
  - `none`
- The `args` are a series of optional parameters (see specific components for more info)
- For convenience, bottom-aligned `y` values are the distance from the bottom of the screen (`full`) or top of the status bar (`ex` and `off`)

This example configures the extended hud for doom with just the stat totals and time in the bottom left (above the status bar):
```
doom ex
stat_totals 2 8 bottom_left
composite_time 2 16 bottom_left
```

Finally, there is a positioning helper: `add_offset y alignment`
- This compensates for mixed stretching between the message font and the extended hud font
- Set `y` as the number of message font component lines at the edge of the given alignment

You can find the current default configuration [here](../prboom2/data/lumps/dsdahud.lmp).

### Components

Unless otherwise specified, argument values are integers. For toggles, a 1 means on and a 0 means off. For example, `stat_totals 2 8 bottom_left 1 0 1` would turn off items but keep kills and secrets enabled.
